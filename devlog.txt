Planning:

Make a "Todo" object: either a class, module, or factory function
  -Has properties: title, description, dueDate, priority

Be able to tab through projects or separate lists of todos
  -When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project to which all of their todos are put. 
  -Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

Application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) should be separate from the DOM-related stuff, so keep all of those things in separate modules.

The look of the User Interface is up to you, but it should be able to do the following:
    view all projects
    view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate.. perhaps changing color for different priorities)
    expand a single todo to see/edit it’s details
    delete a todo

Use localStorage to save users' projects and todos

Consider external libraries like date-fns, which gives you a bunch of handy functions for formatting and manipulating dates and times

const todo = ...
  const title, description, dueDate, priority
  return { info }

const todoController = ...
  store todo list
  CRUD
  Subscribe?

const domManager = ...
  Display page and lists
  Handle button presses (new, edit, delete, completed)
  Publish?
